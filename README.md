How the Board Will Be Used:  

Organizing Tasks: Tasks will initially be placed in the To Do column for prioritization.  
Tracking Progress: Tasks will move to the In Progress column once they are actively being worked on.  
Monitoring Completion: Tasks will be shifted to the Done column upon completion, providing a clear view of progress.  
Collaborating Effectively: Tasks will be assigned to team members directly from the board for better coordination.  
Reviewing and Adjusting: The board will be reviewed during meetings to address blockers and adjust priorities as needed.  

Reflection on GitHub Project Management Tools:  

Using GitHub's tools such as project boards, milestones, and issues has streamlined the management of my portfolio project. Milestones allow me to divide the project into manageable goals, helping me focus on specific objectives. Issues enable detailed tracking of tasks or problems, ensuring nothing is overlooked. Linking issues to milestones helps maintain a clear structure and progression. The project board visually displays the project's status, showing completed tasks and pending ones at a glance.  

A potential challenge is forgetting to keep the board updated, which could lead to confusion. To address this, I plan to regularly check and update the board to maintain clarity. Overall, these tools have proven invaluable in staying organized and ensuring steady progress on my project.
